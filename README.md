# MATLAB MVNX Library
A library of MATLAB tools to make Xsens MVNX data analysis easier. Contains functions for
importing MVNX files to matlab, extracting features, and data analysis.

## Usage
Please see the help text at the beginning of every file in the library for specific usage directions.
As the size of this library increases, I may need to create a more thorough, centralized documentation.
Until then, I believe this library should be straightforward enough to use.
